# About

[![CI](https://github.com/innotelinc/AnyPS5/actions/workflows/ci.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/innotelinc/AnyPS5/actions/workflows/ci.yml)
[![License: GPL-2.0](https://img.shields.io/badge/license-GPL--2.0-blue.svg)](LICENSE)


Tool for automatic executables porting to Linux and Windows.

Includes a [relinker](core/relinker) that converts executable to the target system's native format and implementations of [system prx libraries](core/libs/prx) suitable for dynamic linking. No emulation or separate runtime process.

[Usage](docs/user/USAGE.md), [Build instructions](docs/dev/BUILD.md), [Architecture](docs/dev/ARCHITECTURE.md), [Technical debt of the project](docs/dev/TechnicalDebt.md), [code style conventions](docs/dev/CONVENTIONS.md), [contributing](CONTRIBUTING.md)

## Why AnyPS5

| Problem | Answer |
| --- | --- |
| An emulator is a second operating system to maintain. | The relinker produces a native executable and native libraries. |
| A port needs the interfaces the binary expects. | The PRX library set supplies them at link time. |
| The work is hard to repeat. | The build and the relink steps are documented and scripted. |

Its place in the stack is [docs/stack.md](docs/stack.md); the canonical
definition of the shared layers is the
[Innotel Platform Stack](https://github.com/innotelinc/innotel-platform-stack).

[List of verified games](docs/user/COMPATIBILITY.md)

Dreaming Sarah (2D platformer) runs at a stable 60 fps on a GTX 1050 Ti / i5-7500 3.4GHz.

Unsupported or unexpected states strictly throw `std::runtime_error`. `what()` is printed to stderr and the process terminates.

The [shader recompiler](core/shader/recompiler/Recompiler.cpp) successfully produces SPIR-V (validated via [Spirv-Tools](3rdparty/SPIRV-Tools) when built with `ANYPS5_ENABLE_SPIRV_TOOLS`).

## Compatibility

See the [game compatibility list](docs/user/COMPATIBILITY.md) for tested games and known issues.

## Input mapping

SDL-mapped game controllers are supported, including analog sticks and triggers. Keyboard and mouse controls can be configured with an `anyps5-input.ini` file. See [input mapping](docs/user/INPUT_MAPPING.md) for the supported devices and configuration format.
